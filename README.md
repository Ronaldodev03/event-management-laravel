## right after creating the laravel project:

go to .env and change the name of the db (DB_DATABASE) and put the name that you want for your db.

## model & migrations:

-   php artisan make:model Event -m (this will also make the migration)

-   php artisan make:model Attendee -m (this will also make the migration)

### migrations

Migrations are like version control for your database schema. They allow you to:

-   Define database structure: The migration you showed (create_events) defines a table with columns for events, including relationships to users.

-   Track changes: Each migration represents a discrete change to your database.

-   Synchronize development: Team members can run migrations to get the same database structure.

-   Roll back changes: You can undo migrations if needed (using the down method).

### models

Models represent your application's data and business logic. They:

-   Interact with database tables: Each model typically corresponds to a database table.

-   Define relationships: Like the user() and attendees() methods in your Event model.

-   Handle data operations: Create, read, update, and delete records.

-   Protect attributes: Your $fillable array specifies which fields can be mass-assigned.

## factory & seeder:

-   php artisan make:factory EventFactory --model=Event

-   php artisan make:sedeer EventSeeder

-   php artisan make:sedeer AttendeeSeeder (doesn't need a factory)

## controllers:

-   php artisan make:controller Api/EventController --api (/Api for the route & --api for having default methods for apis in the controller)

-   php artisan make:controller Api/AttendeeController --api (/Api for the route & --api for having default methods for apis in the controller)

### Route Model Binding

Route Model Binding automatically injects Laravel model instances into controller methods by matching route parameters (like {event}) to database records - when you type-hint a model (e.g., Event $event), Laravel fetches it by ID (or custom column) and returns a 404 if not found, eliminating manual queries like Event::find($id). It works for both primary keys (/events/1) and custom fields (like slugs /events/my-event), and can enforce relationships in nested routes (e.g., ensuring an attendee belongs to an event).

## api resources:

-   php artisan make:resource EventResource

-   php artisan make:resource UserResource

Laravel API Resources transform Eloquent models into JSON responses with a clean, consistent structure. They act as a middle layer between models and API responses, letting us control exactly what data gets returned (e.g., hiding sensitive fields, formatting dates, or including relationships). For example, an EventResource can customize how event data appears in API responses without modifying the model itself. We can use them to standardize responses, reduce redundancy, and handle complex data transformations.

## Query Builder

You get a query builder when you call an Eloquent method with parentheses ():

### When You Get a Query Builder Instance

-   $builder1 = Event::query();
-   $builder2 = $event->attendees(); // With parentheses
-   $builder3 = User::where('active', true);

### How to Execute a Query Builder

Convert it to usable data with these methods:

#### Get a Collection (all results)

        $collection = $builder->get();

#### Get a Paginator (chunked results)

        $paginator = $builder->paginate(10);

#### Get First/Find Specific Record

        $singleModel = $builder->first();
        $singleModel = $builder->find(1);

## Relation Loading Trait (this are put manually in the code, there is no command):

A "Relation Loading Trait" in Laravel is a reusable trait that standardizes how relationships (like user or attendees) are eager-loaded in queries, letting you dynamically load relationships via URL parameters (e.g., ?with=user,attendees). It checks valid relationships, applies eager-loading, and keeps controllers cleanâ€”ideal for APIs where clients control which relations to fetch.

-   I only included in index for EventController

-   If I want to include it in other method of the EventController I would have to change the return, for example (show method):

    public function show(Event $event)
    {
        // return new EventResource($event);
    return new EventResource($this->loadRelationships($event));
    }

## auth:

-   php artisan make:controller Api/EventController
